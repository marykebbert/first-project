My first SWIFT project

Basic overview: 
- This is a recipe app which takes recipes from the internet and places them in a more readable format for the user. With a filtering function and a shopping list, users can search for recipes that sound good to them, and add the ingredients to a shopping list.

Desired extensions:
- I would like to be able to add more recipes to this app, but need to learn how to read them in from a webpage (how to extract the JSON file from webpages instead of using a pre-made JSON file). This would allow me to add the option of letting the user add their own recipies.
- Expand the filtering function so that it is less strict in terms of the order of the words and can also search for ingredients within the recipe rather than just the title.
